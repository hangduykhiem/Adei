# Adei
Adei is an opinionated Automated Development Environment Installer.

## Purpose
Adei was written because the frustration I encounter when setting up a new Ubuntu installation. Like the name stated, the sole purpose of Adei is to help setting up my development environment as fast as possible on a fresly installed Ubuntu machine. 

## What's included
Currently, Adei will install:
  - zsh
  - java 8
  - android studio
  - vim
  - pip*
    - pipenv
    - flake8
    - autoPep8
    - jedi
  - build-essential and cmake
  - docker CE

*: Pip is installed in `~/.local/bin` for security purpose.

## What's next
  - [ ] Progress tracking
  - [ ] Android SDK autosetup?
  - [ ] Log clean up - silent install?
  - [ ] ...
